/**
 * What trim.js makes of Instagram's header, checked against a page that is not
 * Instagram's.
 *
 *     npm install jsdom && node Tools/read-the-header.js
 *
 * The header has cost this project more commits than everything else in it put
 * together, and every one of them was settled by building the app, waiting for
 * TestFlight and looking at a photograph. That is a long way to go to find out
 * that a selector matched nothing.
 *
 * So the finding is separated from the arranging. Which three controls trim.js
 * picks out of a bar is a question about a document, and a document can be
 * written here — the arrangement itself is four rules of CSS and belongs to the
 * browser. What these check is the part that has actually gone wrong: an
 * element found, or not found, or found twice.
 *
 * jsdom lays nothing out, so `getBoundingClientRect` is answered from a
 * `data-box` attribute on the fixture. That is enough: the only geometry the
 * script asks about is how big a control is.
