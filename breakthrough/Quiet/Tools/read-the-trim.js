/**
 * The part of trim.js the app's promise actually rests on.
 *
 *     npm install jsdom && node Tools/read-the-trim.js
 *
 * The header had a tool of its own because the header had cost the most
 * commits. These are the checks nobody wrote, and they cover the things that
 * fail *silently* — which is worse than failing loudly, because an entrance
 * that quietly reappears looks exactly like an app that is working.
 *
 * Four questions:
 *
 *   1. Does a tap that would open Reels or Explore get refused, and does a
 *      profile whose name merely starts with those letters get left alone?
 *   2. Does a block Instagram inserted get hidden — and, far more important,
 *      does an ordinary post survive? A reel that gets through is a bug. A gap
 *      where a friend's photograph used to be is a betrayal.
 *   3. Does every phrase in the list actually match something? The list is
 *      twenty-odd hand-written strings in a dozen languages and a typo in any
 *      one of them is invisible from Swift, from CI and from the phone.
 *   4. Does the script notice when Instagram's own client changes the page
 *      without loading anything?
