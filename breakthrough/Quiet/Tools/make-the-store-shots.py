"""Compose the App Store screenshots from photographs of the running app.

App Store Connect wants 1320 x 2868 for the 6.9-inch iPhone, and it wants it
exactly: a smaller image is rejected on upload rather than scaled. The
`Screenshots` workflow already photographs every screen Quiet owns at precisely
that size, on a Pro Max, through the same build a person would install. This
turns those photographs into the five frames a listing needs, and it does not
draw a single pixel of app: whatever is inside the card came off a running
phone. Apple's guidelines require that, and it is also the only version worth
having — a mockup is a promise the app then has to keep.

What it adds is the part a screenshot cannot carry by itself.

*A caption.* Somebody scrolling search results reads two lines and decides. The
headline is the app's own serif, which is the one typographic decision Quiet has
already made, and it is set at the same size across the whole set so the five
frames read as a set rather than as five posters.

*The status bar goes.* Not retouched — cut. The 54 points above the app belong
to iOS, they carry a battery level and a time that mean nothing to a reader, and
the crop is honest in a way that painting over them is not. What is left starts
where the app starts.

*The ground.* `Paper.night`, which is the colour the app itself stands in, so
the frame around the card is the same dark as the card's own edges and there is
no seam.

    python3 Tools/make-the-store-shots.py --source shots/store --out shots/store-frames

Verified by `read-the-shots.py`, which is the thing that actually runs in CI:
the size, the absence of an alpha channel, and that every frame carries both a
caption and a photograph rather than a rectangle of ground.

# --- What the listing says -------------------------------------------------
#
# Order is the whole argument. The first two or three frames carry most of the
# decision, so they are, in order: what is different (a feed with the endless
# surfaces gone), what nothing else does (a limit that is easy to lower and
# slow to raise), and that it actually bites (the day ending). Trust and the
# smallness of setting it up come after, for the person who is already reading.
#
# Headlines are short because they are read at a thumbnail's size. Every one of
# them is a sentence the app itself could say.

# Every frame is a screen Quiet drew itself. Not one of them is a photograph of
# Instagram, and that is a decision rather than an accident: a listing whose
# pictures are all somebody else's product raises guideline 5.2.1 before a
# reviewer has read a word, and the thing being sold here is the limiter, not
# the site it limits. The absence of Reels is a sentence; it is not a picture.
#
# The exception is allowed for and has to be supplied by hand. A photograph of
# a signed-in feed cannot come out of CI — no runner has an Instagram account —
# so if somebody drops one in as `feed.png`, from their own phone, it becomes
# the first frame and everything else moves down. Without it the set is these
# five and reads perfectly well.
#
# Order is the whole argument. The first two or three carry most of the
# decision, so they are: what the app is for, the one rule nothing else has,
# and the proof that the rule bites. Trust comes last, for somebody who is
# already reading.
#
# Four, not five. The screen the app opens with was in this set until the
# frames were looked at: it is one centred line on an otherwise empty page,
# which is right for a second and a half in a hand and is a blank rectangle at
# the size a listing is actually read. A frame whose card says nothing is worse
# than no frame, and four is inside the three-to-five that works.
